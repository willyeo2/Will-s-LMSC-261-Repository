## Final Project Proposal
### Will Yeo
### LMSC 261
### April 6, 2020

#### 1. Description of the deliverable:

For my final LMSC-261 project, I want to build a personal website that serves as an online springboard for my career. My website will accomplish three things:

  - It should attract followers to my work as a recording and visual artist.
  - It will advertise my skills as an audio engineer, music producer, and multimedia designer for potential clients.
  - It will act as an online resume for potential employers.

#### 2. What problem does the project solve?

At Berklee, I have been so focused on building my skills and working on projects that I have neglected to market myself adequately. As of now, I have nothing online that displays the work I have created. This website should serve as an exhibition for that work and my hope is that the design reflects the creativity and effort that I put into my artistic projects.

My time at Berklee has also centered around schoolwork rather than paid opportunities. I want to start drawing income as a freelance audio engineer, producer, and visual artist and to accomplish that, I need to begin building a client base. This website should show potential clients what I can offer them and help me field inquiries.

Finally, in the immediate future, I need a job in order to pay my rent after graduation. An online resume that clearly lists my skills and experience for employers would be valuable in my job search.

#### 3. What resources will you use?


#### 4. What are the use cases?

The intended audience for my website will consist of:

  - Followers and potential patrons of my music and visual artwork
  - People needing the services of an audio engineer, sound designer, music producer, or multimedia designer.
  - Hiring managers at recording studios, music producers in need of an assistant, or other potential employers researching job applicants.

#### 5. Timeline

April 6: Complete wireframe mockup of the website.
April 6 - 13: Research HTML, CSS, javaScript, and Bootstrap for creative techniques to make the website visually appealing and effective from a messaging standpoint.
April 13 - 20: Create site structure and content. This should include all text, graphics, images, video, audio files, hyperlinks and the workflow of pages within the site.

April 27 - May 4: Test website, solicit feedback and make adjustments as needed.
