## Final Project Proposal
### Will Yeo
### LMSC 261
### April 6, 2020

For my final LMSC-261 project, I want to build a personal website that serves as an online springboard for my career. My website will accomplish three things. 1. It should attract followers to my work as a recording and visual artist. 2. It will advertise my skills as an audio engineer, music producer, and multimedia designer for potential clients. 3. It will act as an online resume for potential employers.

1. What problem does the project solve?


2. What resources will you use?

3. What are the use cases?

4. Timeline

5. How do you think you should be assessed?
