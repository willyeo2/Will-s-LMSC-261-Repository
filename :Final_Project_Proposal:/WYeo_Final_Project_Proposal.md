## Final Project Proposal
### Will Yeo
### LMSC 261
### April 6, 2020

#### 1. Description of the deliverable:

For my final LMSC-261 project, I want to build a personal website that serves as an online springboard for my career. My website will accomplish three things:

  - It should help build my audience as a recording and visual artist.
  - It will advertise my skills as an audio engineer, music producer, and multimedia designer for potential clients.
  - It will act as an online resume for potential employers.

#### 2. What problem does the project solve?

At Berklee, I have been so focused on building my skills and working on projects that I have neglected to market myself adequately. As of now, I have nothing online that displays the work I have created. This website should serve as an exhibition for that work and my hope is that the design reflects the creativity and effort that I put into my artistic projects.

My time at Berklee has also centered around schoolwork rather than paid opportunities. I want to start drawing income as a freelance audio engineer, producer, and visual artist and to accomplish that, I need to begin building a client base. This website should show potential clients what I can offer them and help me field inquiries.

Finally, in the immediate future, I need a job in order to pay my rent after graduation. An online resume that clearly lists my skills and experience for employers would be valuable in my job search.

#### 3. What resources will you use?

In addition to the information on HTML and javaScript from our class lectures, the resources from the "Networks" lesson on our class Github page has been extremely helpful. I found the (w3chools CSS tutorial)(https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp) especially useful for finding design elements to incorporate into my site. I have also been taking the Codeacademy.com introductory courses on HTML and CSS to bolster my basic knowledge of each. In order to make my site more visually appealing, I have found numerous Youtube tutorials, like this one from DevTips, that explain the different creative techniques that are possible using CSS.

#### 4. What are the use cases?

The intended audience for my website will consist of:

  - Followers and potential patrons of my music and visual artwork
  - People needing the services of an audio engineer, sound designer, music producer, or multimedia designer.
  - Hiring managers at recording studios, music producers in need of an assistant, or other potential employers researching job applicants.

#### 5. Timeline
April 6 - 13: Research HTML, CSS, javaScript, and Bootstrap for creative techniques to make the website visually appealing and effective from a messaging standpoint.
April 13 - 20: Create site structure and content. This should include all text, graphics, images, video, audio files, hyperlinks and the workflow of pages within the site.
April 20 - 27: Add creative design elements including CSS animations and Bootstrap graphics.
April 27 - May 4: Test website, solicit feedback, and make adjustments as needed.

#### 6. How do you think you should be assessed?

I want to be assessed on the effectiveness of my website in achieving the goals I laid out. Would it help a listener of my music find out more about me, and direct them to my other recordings? Does it display my visual work in a way that would make a touring artist want to use one of my designs? Would it show an established producer that I possess the skill set they are looking for in an assistant? These broad goals also need to be accomplished in a clear and concise way that is visually appealing to the user.
