## Final Project Proposal
### Will Yeo
### LMSC 261
### April 6, 2020

1. Description of the deliverable:

For my final LMSC-261 project, I want to build a personal website that serves as an online springboard for my career. My website will accomplish three things.

  - It should attract followers to my work as a recording and visual artist.
  - It will advertise my skills as an audio engineer, music producer, and multimedia designer for potential clients.
  - It will act as an online resume for potential employers.

2. What problem does the project solve?

At Berklee, I have been so focused on building my skills and working on projects that I have completely neglected to market myself adequately. At the moment, I have nothing online that displays the work I have spent so much time creating. This website should serve as an exhibition for that work and my hope is that the design reflects the creativity and effort that I put into my artistic projects.

 My time at Berklee has also focused on primarily around schoolwork rather than paid opportunities. I would like to start building a base of clients as a freelance audio engineer, producer, and visual artist.

 Finally, in the immediate future, I need a site that could serve as a resume for potential employers following graduation.
