1. What I Did:
- Our assignment this week was to complete the "Foursquare" assignment which involved printing a pattern with four squares using a Python Script. I completed the problem using a combination of loops, "if/else" statements and the python functions we learned about in class two weeks ago.

2. How I Did It:
- I completed the problem by creating two functions consisting of "if/else" statements nested inside of a "while" loop. The first function, "print_horizontal" printed the horizontal lines with this pattern:

              <pre>
                          + - - - - + - - - - +
              <pre>
