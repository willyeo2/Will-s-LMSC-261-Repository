### Will Yeo Assignment 1 Documentation
1. What I did:
    - Created an outline of Paul Ford's article "What *is* Code?" from Bloomberg.com using Markdown Syntax.
2. How I did it:
    - First, I read Paul Ford's Article.
    - Next, I created a new document in my GitHub Repository using Atom.
    - I created the outline using the "Markdown Cheatsheet" document and the edit view of the class syllabus as a reference.
    - I uploaded the outline to my online GitHub Repository from Atom.
3. Problems I faced:
    - It took me a couple tries before I understood how to use the list function.
    - It took me longer than anticipated to read the full article.
4. How I overcame them:
    - The markdown cheatsheet was valuable, but it took some trial and error before I realized that new lists have to begin again at "1" and can't continue from the previous number if there is other text between them.
5. Code I used from others/elsewhere:
  - I used [Adam Pritchard's "Markdown Cheatsheet" document](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#hr) and the "README.md" document](https://github.com/rdwrome/LMSC261-SP20/edit/master/README.md) on the LMSC261 Class Repository as a reference.
