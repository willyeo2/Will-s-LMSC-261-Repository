1. What I Did:

For my final LMSC 261 project I chose to build my own professional website. As a soon-to-be Berklee graduate, I wanted to put my newfound coding skills to good use with a project that would benefit my career immediately and that I had been putting off for too long. I needed a website that could help me field inquiries from potential clients needing an audio engineer and that could show off my others skills as a music and visual artist.

From my capstone Electronic Production and Design project, I had also accumulated a large amount of footage that I had shot for my jury presentation and senior showcase videos. For that reason, I wanted a website that could display video in the background and show what I had been working on.
