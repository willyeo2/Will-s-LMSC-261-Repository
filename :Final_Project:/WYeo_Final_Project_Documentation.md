1. What I Did:

For my final LMSC 261 project I chose to build my own professional website. As a soon-to-be Berklee graduate, I wanted to put my newfound coding skills to good use with a project that would benefit my career immediately and that I had been putting off for too long. I needed a website that could help me field inquiries from potential clients needing an audio engineer and that could show off my others skills as a music and visual artist.

From my capstone Electronic Production and Design project, I had also accumulated a large amount of footage that I had shot for my jury presentation and senior showcase videos. For that reason, I wanted a website that could display video in the background and show what I had been working on.

2. How I Did It:

After taking a couple Codeacademy classes on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap, I broke down and went searching for templates that were similar to what I was looking for. I combined elements of a few different designs, but I found one called "Highway", located [here] (https://templatemo.com/tm-520-highway) that had a looping video on the landing page. I also practiced experimenting with the CSS templates on the W3schools.com tutorial site in order to become more familiar with CSS syntax and selectors.

Once I downloaded the template, I spent time making sure I had all the proper graphics I wanted to import into my site. I wanted a main landing page, a page with my music and a page with information about my engineering services, so I searched for photos and videos that I thought fit each category. Using video from my 491 project, a trip to Real World Studios in England and a music festival I worked at, I edited together the video in the background of the "home" page and the "music" page using Adobe Premier.

In the index.html file I included a "video" tag in the "video-container" div of the main page. I set the source tag equal to the file location of the video and copied the file into the project folder of my site. Next, I uploaded the jpg and png images that I selected in each of my website sections. In the "music" section, I got rid of the template graphics and embedded links to my Soundcloud page (which is also in dire need of updating).
