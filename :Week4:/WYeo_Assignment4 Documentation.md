1. What I Did:
- For our Week 4 assignment, we had to modify the thinkoutside.c program from our class GitHub repository in order to make it produce a pyramid of hash marks, which increase by one with each succeeding line for 8 lines.
2. How I Did It:
- I started off by testing different values for integers "i" and "j", then compiling and running the program from terminal to identify which parameters they controlled. Using this method, I realized that setting the value "int i" was being tested against would control how many times the printf("\n") command would run, and therefore determine how many rows would be printed. Changing the value "int j" was being tested against determined how many times the printf("#") command would run and print a hashmark.
