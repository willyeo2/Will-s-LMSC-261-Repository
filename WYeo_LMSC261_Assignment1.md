I. Introduction
 1. Illustrative story about Thrifty Corporate VP not understanding what coders do.  
 2. Why Are We Here
     - Author discusses his programming background

II. "Let's Begin" - Explanation of How Computers Function and Industry Trends  
 1. Computers make basic calculations. A lot of them per second.
 2. Seemingly simple commands from a human user are broken down into tasks by the computer.
 3. The rise of software and developers
     - As software has become untethered from hardware, developers have become more valuable and numerous.
     - Software applications are now ubiquitous and indispensable to many industries
 4. How code becomes software
 5. Algorithms and how different languages perform them
 6. Developer culture
    - Back to the story showing how programmers have changed corporate culture
    - Tech conferences: there's a lot of them
    - Gender gap problem in tech

  III. The Languages
   1. There are numerous programming languages and professional coders need to be familiar with many of them.
       - Languages often change or become obsolete and new languages become more popular
       - Programmers must stay up to date on what languages are currently in use
       - Creating a valuable, widely used language is difficult and requires skill and good luck
    2. The Value of Libraries
        - Standard libraries and prewritten modules allow programmers to quickly use complex functions that have already been coded
        - Developing proficiency with a language requires familiarity with that language's standard libraries and their capabilities
    3. Some languages are more useful for certain tasks than others.
    4. C is the grandaddy of them all
    5. Explanation and history of object-oriented programming
    6. The value of Python
        - Provides more abstractions that make it more user friendly.
        - "Glue Language" - Older, faster code can be embedded in the easier to use Python language

  IV. "Why Are Coders Angry" - The Psychology of of Programmers  
   1. The tech industry is constantly shifting and specific knowledge can become obsolete quickly.
   2. The stereotypical programmer is obsessive, male, and isolated, but those are not requirements.
   3. The conflict of motivations between coders and corporate executives
   4. Back to the story illustrating the conflict of motivations between coders and corporate executives
   5. The cultural differences between users of different languages   

V. The Architecture of Computers  
 1. Decoding programmer conversations
 2. The necessity of data management
 3. The value of databases
 4. Java and its dominance in corporations
 5. Microsoft
 6. "Liquid Infrastructure" - There are many sizes and types of software applications.
 7. JavaScript's tenuous relationship with Java
 8. PHP

 VI. Applications
